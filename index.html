            Zambales, located in the Philippines' Central Luzon region, offers
            enjoyable Zambales activities such as relaxing on sandy beaches,
            having an intimate camping experience, riding the waves, traveling
            to a volcano, jumping in an inflatable playground, and more.
            Zambales features historical sites as well. Ramon Magsaysay, the
            Philippines' adored President, hails from Castillejos, the
            province's ancestral home. You can also go to Capones Island, which
            has a fascinating history and a stunning rocky backdrop.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            If you're planning a vacation to Zambales, don't forget to include
            these tourist attractions and activities in your itinerary.Plan a
            trip to Zambales, a short beach break from Manila. In this book,
            you'll find the best sights and must-do activities.Although Zambales
            is only 3-4 hours away from the bustling metropolis of Manila, it
            offers a wide range of exciting activities and attractions ideal for
            families, couples, and groups of friends.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Zambales is one of those areas that has it all: pristine forest
            landscapes, the Sierra Madre mountain range, living-tradition towns,
            and 107 miles of pristine beach. There's also a slew of interesting
            islands and shoals for day trips and peaceful camping.The province
            comprises 13 municipalities and one city, Olongapo, all of which are
            serviced by public air-conditioned buses from Metro Manila's Cubao
            or Pasay. Zambales is located on the west coast of the Philippines,
            thus surfers can anticipate to have a good time, especially in San
            Narciso and San Felipe. There are many of resorts in these coastal
            towns, but The Circle Hostel in San Felipe is the newest addition.
            It's basic (think three-level bunk beds with no air conditioning),
            but hey, you can paint on the walls, try slacklining (tightrope
            walking), and attend monthly yoga classes.

                Subic Bay. Since its debut in 2017, Inflatable Island has become

                Potipot is without a doubt one of the most accessible islands in
                the country. A motorized banca or outrigger boat can be rented
                from Uacon in Candelaria, only a little distance off the main
                highway, and taken to the island in 5-10 minutes. Potipot has
                grown in popularity in recent years. We arrived on a Monday,
                which was good because the site is reported to be crowded on
                weekends. Fortunately, the island has retained its natural
                beauty. Potipot itself has no resorts, though there are a few
                huts for rent if you want to stay the night. There are basic
                bathrooms and shower rooms (but no showers — bathing requires
                retrieving water from a deep well).

                El Kabayo is undoubtedly the best venue in the country to learn
                and ride horses. The facility is located in Zambales' Subic Bay
                Freeport Zone and is home to healthy and friendly horses.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                With its well-kept gardens, ample ground area, and country-style
                architecture, the ranch is simply appealing. Wildlife In Need, a
                non-profit organization specializing in animal care and welfare,
                oversees the stables.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                All revenues from the horseback riding activities go directly to
                the care and welfare of the lovely horses. Horseback riding
                lessons and a guided excursion through the lush woodland around
                El Kabayo Falls are available.

                Feel free to escape on horseback in El Salvador, whether you're
                an equestrian or just want to hang out with horses.

                The Philippine Carabao Mango is found in Zambales. Rosa Farms
                has some sweet mangoes that you may pick and eat. It's a
                12.5-hectare mango orchard in San Marcelino-San Antonio
                Boundary, Zambales, located along the National Highway.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The mangoes, the herb garden, the swing, the country store, and
                the café are just a few of the delights on offer. The farm's
                "Select & Pay" service allows visitors to pick mangoes directly
                from the trees. It's ideal for mango-obsessed children and
                adults!

                Visit the ancestral home of famous former Philippine President
                Ramon Magsaysay in Castillejos on a side excursion to learn
                about Zambales' history. In 1990, the home was refurbished and
                turned into a museum.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                After being severely damaged by the Mt. Pinatubo explosion in
                1991, the National Historical Institute rebuilt and refurbished
                it in 1999.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The modest but lovely two-story edifice houses souvenirs and
                personal mementos of the previous president, such as photographs
                and medals.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                The historical landmark has some of Ramon Magsaysay's keen
                Barong Tagalogs on exhibit. The museum also houses his old
                Presidential automobile, the Willy Jeep.

                so well-liked and respected.
